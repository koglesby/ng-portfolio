      Welcome to my portfolio!
    </p>
    <p>
      Earned BA in Film Studies from UC Davis in 2013. I learned several applications from Adobe Creative Suite,
      as well as some music production software (as a hobby) while I worked unrelated jobs.
      In late 2016, I wrote my first few lines of Ruby code, and decided to dedicate my time to become a
      Web Developer. I enrolled in the Firehose Project coding camp, where I created my first Web Apps in
      Ruby on Rails, learned computer science fundamentals, and collaborated with other students to
      build our capstone project. Since completing the camp, I have continued to *widen my
      knowledge-base and improve my skills*, getting to know the Angular front-end framework, more
      practice with javascript and tools such as Firebase.
