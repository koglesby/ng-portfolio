        Welcome to my online portfolio!
        My name is Kevin and I'm a Web Developer from Davis, California.
        I earned my Bachelor Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies from UC Davis in 2013.
        <!--After graduating, I worked a few different jobs (in food service, landscaping, customer service...)-->
        I realized upon graduating that I still hadn't acquired the kinds of skills
        that I found personally interesting.
        I developed skills in creative applications soon after graduating, while working different odd jobs.
        In late 2016, I enrolled in coding courses in 2016,
        where I learned computer science fundamentals,
        and developed my first web applications in Ruby on Rails.
